# Falling Color Boxes #

Inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt's](https://github.com/jendewalt) lovely [Technicolor Boxes](https://jenniferdewalt.com/technicolor_boxes.html). Written for [Academy Pittsburgh](https://www.academypgh.com) Session 14, on May 19th, 2022.

An opportunity for me to learn about:

* [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver)
* Dynamically setting CSS styles
* Changing element sizes and counts for responsive design
